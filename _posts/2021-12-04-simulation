- Performed 5GB historical medical helicopter call data ETL with PySpark; stored data in MongoDB and interacted with database on exploratory analysis.
- Applied Simpy to simulate helicopter dispatch process. Identified top 5 bases out of 3093 cities, allocated 12 helicpters bases, and visulized base-helicopter distribution with Seaborn. 
- Built an interactive helicopter base location selection system, enabling future expansion of bases and acquisition of helicopters.
- Achieved ~64% reduction in response time, helped increase ~37% follow-up treatment recovery rate. 
- Detailed project report can be found [here][simreport].
