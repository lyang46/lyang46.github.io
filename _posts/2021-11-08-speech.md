- Performed fast fourier transform and obtained spectrogram on 5GB audio files as feature extraction, reducing the dimensionality of audio data using PCA to filter out noises.
- Built neural network and convolution neural network using Pytorch, achieving 98.2% accuracy on training set and 93.8% accuracy on validation set with NN model, and achieving 99% accuracy on training set and validation set with CNN model, with final output prediction achieving 95.5% accuracy.
- Detailed project report can be found [here][nnreport].
